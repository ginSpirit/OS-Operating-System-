# Operating System (CSE-310) Lab Tasks & Assignments

This repository contains various C++ programs developed as part of the Operating System (CSE-310) course taken by **Md. Zahurul Haque**. Throughout this course, we have completed numerous lab tasks and assignments, which have been implemented successfully.

## Categories and Programs

### Category 1:
- **FCFS (First-Come, First-Served)**: This is a scheduling algorithm where the process that arrives first is executed first.
- **RR (Round Robin)**: A time-sharing scheduling algorithm where each process is assigned a fixed time slice.
- **SJF (Shortest Job First)**: A scheduling algorithm that selects the process with the smallest burst time to execute next.

The input for these programs is provided in the `brust.txt` file.

### Category 2:
- **SRJF (Shortest Remaining Job First)**: A preemptive version of SJF where the process with the least remaining execution time is selected.
  
The input for SRJF is provided in the `arrival.txt` file.

### Category 3:
- **PQ (Priority Queue)**: A scheduling algorithm that executes processes based on priority.
- **RRPQ (Round Robin + Priority Queue)**: A combination of the Round Robin and Priority Queue scheduling algorithms, where processes are prioritized but still have a time slice for execution.
  
The input for these programs is provided in the `priority.txt` file.
